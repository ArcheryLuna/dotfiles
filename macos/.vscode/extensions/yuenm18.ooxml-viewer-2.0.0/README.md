### Get diff when OOXML documents are edited from outside, e.g. in Microsoft Word, Libre Office Writer, Microsoft Excel, Libre Office Calc, etc.

When a document opened by the OOXML Viewer is edited from an external program, changed parts are marked with a yellow asterisk, deleted parts are marked with a red asterisk, and new parts are marked with a green asterisk.

To view a diff with the previous version of an OOXML part, right click on the part in the OOXML Viewer menu and click "Compare with Previous".

### Search all parts

To search all parts, right click on the OOXML package in the tree view, select "Search Parts", enter your search term, and press enter/return. The initial search is not case sensitive or whole words only, but once the OOXML Viewer opens the search pane, all VS Code search options are available.

### Search parts of any file that uses the Open Packaging Conventions

By default, the OOXML Viewer can view and edit the contents of files with these extensions: ".docx", ".xlsx", ".pptx", ".odt", ".ods", ".odp", ".docm", ".dotm", ".xlsm", ".pptm", ".dotx", ".xltx", ".xltm", ".potx", ".sldx", ".ppsx". But the OOXML Viewer extension can be used with any file type that uses the [Open Packaging Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/opc/open-packaging-conventions-overview) or any zip based file type.

To add additional file types, open the `settings.json` and add or update the `files.associations` and add an associate with "ooxml". For example, to add "\*.vsix" files, settings.json should include

```json
"files.associations": {
  "*.vsix": "ooxml"
}
```

After adding the file extension, restart VS Code and right click on the file to open and select "Open OOXML File" to view and edit it's contents.
