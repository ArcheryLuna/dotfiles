Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

-->\n\n## Installing\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g typescript-language-server typescript\n```\n\n## Running the language server\n\n```\ntypescript-language-server --stdio\n```\n\n## CLI Options\n\n```\n  Usage: typescript-language-server [options]\n\n\n  Options:\n\n    -V, --version                          output the version number\n    --stdio                                use stdio (required option)\n    --log-level <log-level>                A number indicating the log level (4 = log, 3 = info, 2 = warn, 1 = error). Defaults to `3`.\n    --tsserver-log-verbosity <verbosity>   [deprecated] Specify tsserver log verbosity (off, terse, normal, verbose). Defaults to `normal`. example: --tsserver-log-verbosity=verbose\n    --tsserver-path <path>                 [deprecated] Specify path to tsserver directory. example: --tsserver-path=/Users/me/typescript/lib/\n    -h, --help                             output usage information\n```\n\n> The `--tsserver-log-verbosity` and `--tsserver-path` options are deprecated and it is recommended to pass those through corresponding `tsserver.*` `initializationOptions` instead.\n\n> Note: The path passed to `--tsserver-path` should be a path to the `[...]/typescript/lib/tssserver.js` file or to the `[...]/typescript/lib/` directory and not to the shell script `[...]/node_modules/.bin/tsserver`. Though for backward-compatibility reasons, the server will try to do the right thing even when passed a path to the shell script.\n\n## initializationOptions\n\nThe language server accepts various settings through the `initializationOptions` object passed through the `initialize` request. Refer to your LSP client's documentation on how to set these. Here is the list of supported options:\n\n| Setting           | Type     | Description                                                                           |\n|:------------------|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| hostInfo          | string   | Information about the host, for example `\"Emacs 24.4\"` or `\"Sublime Text v3075\"`. **Default**: `undefined` |\n| completionDisableFilterText  | boolean | Don't set `filterText` property on completion items. **Default**: `false` |\n| disableAutomaticTypingAcquisition | boolean | Disables tsserver from automatically fetching missing type definitions (`@types` packages) for external modules. |\n| maxTsServerMemory | number   | The maximum size of the V8's old memory section in megabytes (for example `4096` means 4GB). The default value is dynamically configured by Node so can differ per system. Increase for very big projects that exceed allowed memory usage. **Default**: `undefined` |\n| npmLocation       | string   | Specifies the path to the NPM executable used for Automatic Type Acquisition. |\n| locale            | string   | The locale to use to show error messages. |\n| plugins           | object[] | An array of `{ name: string, location: string }` objects for registering a Typescript plugins. **Default**: [] |\n| preferences       | object   | Preferences passed to the Typescript (`tsserver`) process. See below for more |\n| tsserver          | object   | Options related to the `tsserver` process. See below for more |\n\nThe `tsserver` setting specifies additional options related to the internal `tsserver` process, like tracing and logging.\n\n```ts\ninterface TsserverOptions {\n    /**\n     * The path to the directory where the `tsserver` log files will be created.\n     * If not provided, the log files will be created within the workspace, inside the `.log` directory.\n     * If no workspace root is provided when initializating the server and no custom path is specified then\n     * the logs will not be created.\n     *\n     * @default undefined\n     */\n    logDirectory?: string;\n    /**\n     * Verbosity of the information logged into the `tsserver` log files.\n     *\n     * Log levels from least to most amount of details: `'terse'`, `'normal'`, `'requestTime`', `'verbose'`.\n     * Enabling particular level also enables all lower levels.\n     *\n     * @default 'off'\n     */\n    logVerbosity?: 'off' | 'terse' | 'normal' | 'requestTime' | 'verbose';\n    /**\n     * The path to the `tsserver.js` file or the typescript lib directory. For example: `/Users/me/typescript/lib/tsserver.js`.\n     */\n    path?: string;\n    /**\n     * The verbosity of logging of the tsserver communication.\n     * Delivered through the LSP messages and not related to file logging.\n     *\n     * @default 'off'\n     */\n    trace?: 'off' | 'messages' | 'verbose';\n    /**\n     * Whether a dedicated server is launched to more quickly handle syntax related operations, such as computing diagnostics or code folding.\n     *\n     * Allowed values:\n     *  - auto: Spawn both a full server and a lighter weight server dedicated to syntax operations. The syntax server is used to speed up syntax operations and provide IntelliSense while projects are loading.\n     *  - never: Don't use a dedicated syntax server.

Those options depend on the version of Typescript used but at the time of writing Typescript v4.4.3 contains these options:\n\n```ts\ninterface UserPreferences {\n    /**\n     * Glob patterns of files to exclude from auto imports. Requires using TypeScript 4.8 or newer in the workspace.\n     * Relative paths are resolved relative to the workspace root.\n     * @since 4.8.2\n     */\n    autoImportFileExcludePatterns: [],\n    disableSuggestions: boolean;\n    quotePreference: \"auto\" | \"double\" | \"single\";\n    /**\n     * If enabled, TypeScript will search through all external modules' exports and add them to the completions list.\n     * This affects lone identifier completions but not completions on the right hand side of `obj.`.\n     */\n    includeCompletionsForModuleExports: boolean;\n    /**\n     * Enables auto-import-style completions on partially-typed import statements.

There are some use cases for calling them manually.\n\n`lsp` refers to the language server protocol types, `tsp` refers to the typescript server protocol types.\n\n### Go to Source Definition\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.goToSourceDefinition`\n        arguments: [\n            lsp.DocumentUri,  // String URI of the document\n            lsp.Position,     // Line and character position (zero-based)\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    lsp.Location[] | null\n    ```\n\n(This command is supported from Typescript 4.7.)\n\n### Apply Workspace Edits\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.applyWorkspaceEdit`\n        arguments: [lsp.WorkspaceEdit]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    lsp.ApplyWorkspaceEditResult\n    ```\n\n### Apply Code Action\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.applyCodeAction`\n        arguments: [\n            tsp.CodeAction,  // TypeScript Code Action object\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n### Apply Refactoring\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.applyRefactoring`\n        arguments: [\n            tsp.GetEditsForRefactorRequestArgs,\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n### Organize Imports\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.organizeImports`\n        arguments: [\n            // The \"skipDestructiveCodeActions\" argument is supported from Typescript 4.4+\n            [string] | [string, { skipDestructiveCodeActions?: boolean }],\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n### Rename File\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.applyRenameFile`\n        arguments: [\n            { sourceUri: string; targetUri: string; },\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n### Configure plugin\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.configurePlugin`\n        arguments: [pluginName: string, configuration: any]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n## Inlay hints (`textDocument/inlayHint`)\n\nFor the request to return any results, some or all of the following options need to be enabled through `preferences`:\n\n```ts\nexport interface InlayHintsOptions extends UserPreferences {\n    includeInlayParameterNameHints: 'none' | 'literals' | 'all';\n    includeInlayParameterNameHintsWhenArgumentMatchesName: boolean;\n    includeInlayFunctionParameterTypeHints: boolean;\n    includeInlayVariableTypeHints: boolean;\n    includeInlayVariableTypeHintsWhenTypeMatchesName: boolean;\n    includeInlayPropertyDeclarationTypeHints: boolean;\n    includeInlayFunctionLikeReturnTypeHints: boolean;\n    includeInlayEnumMemberValueHints: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n## TypeScript Version Notification\n\nRight after initializing, the server sends a custom `$/typescriptVersion` notification that carries information about the version of TypeScript that is utilized by the server. The editor can then display that information in the UI.\n\nThe `$/typescriptVersion` notification params include two properties:\n\n - `version` - a semantic version (for example `4.8.4`)\n - `source` - a string specifying whether used TypeScript version comes from the local workspace (`workspace`), is explicitly specified through a `initializationOptions.tsserver.path` setting (`user-setting`) or was bundled with the server (`bundled`)\n\n## Supported Protocol features\n\n- [x] textDocument/codeAction\n- [x] textDocument/completion (incl. `completion/resolve`)\n- [x] textDocument/definition\n- [x] textDocument/didChange (incremental)\n- [x] textDocument/didClose\n- [x] textDocument/didOpen\n- [x] textDocument/didSave\n- [x] textDocument/documentHighlight\n- [x] textDocument/documentSymbol\n- [x] textDocument/executeCommand\n- [x] textDocument/formatting\n- [x] textDocument/hover\n- [x] textDocument/inlayHint (no support for `inlayHint/resolve` or `workspace/inlayHint/refresh`)\n- [x] textDocument/linkedEditingRange\n- [x] textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy\n- [x] callHierarchy/incomingCalls\n- [x] callHierarchy/outgoingCalls\n- [x] textDocument/prepareRename\n- [x] textDocument/rangeFormatting\n- [x] textDocument/references\n- [x] textDocument/rename\n- [x] textDocument/selectionRange\n- [x] textDocument/signatureHelp\n- [x] workspace/symbol\n- [x] workspace/didChangeConfiguration\n- [x] workspace/executeCommand\n\n## Development\n\n### Build\n\n```sh\nyarn\n```\n\n### Test\n\n - `yarn test` - run all tests\n - `yarn test:watch` - run all tests and enable watch mode for developing\n\nBy default only console logs of level `warning` and higher are printed to the console. You can override the `CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL` level in `package.json` to either `log`, `info`, `warning` or `error` to log other levels.\n\n### Watch\n\n```sh\nyarn watch\n```\n\n### Publishing\n\nNew version of the package is published automatically on pushing new tag to the upstream repo.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","gitHead":"305f9d888e8a0ae076e8243d961fe8309cee5780","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server#readme","_id":"typescript-language-server@3.3.3-0","_nodeVersion":"16.19.0","_npmVersion":"8.19.3","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-I6msSDp5c8cnS4tnxH/gPICt6UrASO92uJ6BKqOHYHvn275WkeMvmuQfCL3hQBUXtldV/odNC9bQuowef7ziBA==","shasum":"e4024b03ebaf399c391565abc41a1e10b597af7c","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/typescript-language-server/-/typescript-language-server-3.3.3-0.tgz","fileCount":5,"unpackedSize":1748782,"signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCICiZpoRPvei+1zjPP1LxbqPfPDUojiNJa/Pn22hUnAotAiEA3LRcc7z0st6QWMCswn5xTRqKa0hU8jKAMU2/Qn6axfo="}]},"_npmUser":{"name":"rchl","email":"rchl2k@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"maintainers":[{"name":"prabir","email":"mail@prabir.me"},{"name":"donniewest","email":"me@donniewest.com"},{"name":"rchl","email":"rchl2k@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/typescript-language-server_3.3.3-0_1694020789827_0.015820778450930106"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.0.0":{"name":"typescript-language-server","version":"4.0.0","description":"Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for TypeScript using tsserver","author":{"name":"TypeFox and others"},"license":"Apache-2.0","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server.git"},"type":"module","engines":{"node":">=18"},"bin":{"typescript-language-server":"lib/cli.mjs"},"scripts":{"clean":"rimraf lib *.tsbuildinfo","test":"cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=warning jest","test:watch":"cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=warning jest --watch","lint":"eslint --ext \".js,.ts\" src","fix":"eslint --ext \".js,.ts\" --fix src","build":"concurrently -n compile,lint -c blue,green \"yarn compile\" \"yarn lint\"","compile":"rimraf lib && rollup --config rollup.config.ts --configPlugin typescript","watch":"rimraf lib && rollup --config rollup.config.ts --configPlugin typescript --watch","size":"yarn build && yarn size-limit","postversion":"git push --follow-tags","prepare":"cd test-data/jsx && yarn"},"eslintIgnore":["!.eslintrc.cjs"],"husky":{"hooks":{"pre-commit":"yarn lint && yarn test && yarn build","post-merge":"yarn"}},"devDependencies":{"@babel/core":"^7.23.2","@babel/preset-env":"^7.23.2","@rollup/plugin-commonjs":"^25.0.7","@rollup/plugin-node-resolve":"^15.2.3","@rollup/plugin-terser":"^0.4.4","@rollup/plugin-typescript":"^11.1.5","@size-limit/file":"^9.0.0","@types/deepmerge":"^2.2.0","@types/fs-extra":"^11.0.3","@types/jest":"^29.5.6","@types/node":"^18.18.6","@types/semver":"^7.5.4","@types/which":"^3.0.1","@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin":"^6.8.0","@typescript-eslint/parser":"^6.8.0","babel-jest":"^29.7.0","commander":"^11.1.0","concurrently":"^8.2.2","cross-env":"^7.0.3","deepmerge":"^4.3.1","eslint":"^8.51.0","eslint-plugin-jest":"^27.4.2","fs-extra":"^11.1.1","husky":"4.x","jest":"^29.7.0","p-debounce":"^4.0.0","pkg-up":"^4.0.0","rimraf":"^5.0.5","rollup":"^4.1.4","semver":"^7.5.4","size-limit":"^9.0.0","source-map-support":"^0.5.21","tempy":"^3.1.0","ts-jest":"^29.1.1","ts-node":"^10.9.1","tslib":"^2.6.2","typescript":"^5.2.2","vscode-jsonrpc":"^8.2.0","vscode-languageserver":"^9.0.1","vscode-languageserver-protocol":"^3.17.5","vscode-languageserver-textdocument":"1.0.11","vscode-uri":"^3.0.8","which":"^4.0.0"},"licenseText":"Parts of the code copied from the https://github.com/microsoft/vscode repository are licensed under the following license:\n\nBEGIN LICENSE ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 - present Microsoft Corporation\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Defaults to `3`.\n    -h, --help                             output usage information\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSee [configuration documentation](./docs/configuration.md).\n\n## Features\n\n### Code actions on save\n\nServer announces support for the following code action kinds:\n\n - `source.fixAll.ts` - despite the name, fixes a couple of specific issues: unreachable code, await in non-async functions, incorrectly implemented interface\n - `source.removeUnused.ts` - removes declared but unused variables\n - `source.addMissingImports.ts` - adds imports for used but not imported symbols\n - `source.removeUnusedImports.ts` - removes unused imports\n - `source.sortImports.ts` - sorts imports\n - `source.organizeImports.ts` - organizes and removes unused imports\n\nThis allows editors that support running code actions on save to automatically run fixes associated with those kinds.\n\nThose code actions, if they apply in the current code, should also be presented in the list of \"Source Actions\" if the editor exposes those.\n\nThe user can enable it with a setting similar to (can vary per-editor):\n\n```js\n\"codeActionsOnSave\": {\n    \"source.organizeImports.ts\": true,\n    // or just\n    \"source.organizeImports\": true,\n}\n```\n\n### Workspace commands (`workspace/executeCommand`)\n\nSee [LSP specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_executeCommand).\n\nMost of the time, you'll execute commands with arguments retrieved from another request like `textDocument/codeAction`. There are some use cases for calling them manually.\n\n`lsp` refers to the language server protocol types, `tsp` refers to the typescript server protocol types.\n\n#### Go to Source Definition\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.goToSourceDefinition`\n        arguments: [\n            lsp.DocumentUri,  // String URI of the document\n            lsp.Position,     // Line and character position (zero-based)\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    lsp.Location[] | null\n    ```\n\n(This command is supported from Typescript 4.7.)\n\n#### Apply Workspace Edits\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.applyWorkspaceEdit`\n        arguments: [lsp.WorkspaceEdit]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    lsp.ApplyWorkspaceEditResult\n    ```\n\n#### Apply Code Action\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.applyCodeAction`\n        arguments: [\n            tsp.CodeAction,  // TypeScript Code Action object\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n#### Apply Refactoring\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.applyRefactoring`\n        arguments: [\n            tsp.GetEditsForRefactorRequestArgs,\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n#### Organize Imports\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.organizeImports`\n        arguments: [\n            // The \"skipDestructiveCodeActions\" argument is supported from Typescript 4.4+\n            [string] | [string, { skipDestructiveCodeActions?: boolean }],\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n#### Rename File\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.applyRenameFile`\n        arguments: [\n            { sourceUri: string; targetUri: string; },\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n#### Configure plugin\n\n- Request:\n    ```ts\n    {\n        command: `_typescript.configurePlugin`\n        arguments: [pluginName: string, configuration: any]\n    }\n    ```\n- Response:\n    ```ts\n    void\n    ```\n\n### Code Lenses (`textDocument/codeLens`)\n\nCode lenses can be enabled using the `implementationsCodeLens` and `referencesCodeLens` [workspace configuration options](/docs/configuration.md/#workspacedidchangeconfiguration).\n\nCode lenses provide a count of **references** and/or **implemenations** for symbols in the document. For clients that support it it's also possible to click on those to navigate to the relevant locations in the the project. Do note that clicking those trigger a `editor.action.showReferences` command which is something that client needs to have explicit support for. Many do by default but some don't. An example command will look like this:\n\n```ts\ncommand: {\n    title: '1 reference',\n    command: 'editor.action.showReferences',\n    arguments: [\n        'file://project/foo.ts',    // URI\n        { line: 1, character: 1 },  // Position\n        [                           // A list of Location objects.\n            {\n                uri: 'file://project/bar.ts',\n                range: {\n                    start: {\n                        line: 7,\n                        character: 24,\n                    },\n                    end: {\n                        line: 7,\n                        character: 28,\n                    },\n                },\n            },\n        ],\n    ],\n}\n```\n\n### Inlay hints (`textDocument/inlayHint`)\n\nFor the request to return any results, some or all of the following options need to be enabled through `preferences`:\n\n```ts\nexport interface InlayHintsOptions extends UserPreferences {\n    includeInlayParameterNameHints: 'none' | 'literals' | 'all';\n    includeInlayParameterNameHintsWhenArgumentMatchesName: boolean;\n    includeInlayFunctionParameterTypeHints: boolean;\n    includeInlayVariableTypeHints: boolean;\n    includeInlayVariableTypeHintsWhenTypeMatchesName: boolean;\n    includeInlayPropertyDeclarationTypeHints: boolean;\n    includeInlayFunctionLikeReturnTypeHints: boolean;\n    includeInlayEnumMemberValueHints: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n### TypeScript Version Notification\n\nRight after initializing, the server sends a custom `$/typescriptVersion` notification that carries information about the version of TypeScript that is utilized by the server. The editor can then display that information in the UI.\n\nThe `$/typescriptVersion` notification params include two properties:\n\n - `version` - a semantic version (for example `4.8.4`)\n - `source` - a string specifying whether used TypeScript version comes from the local workspace (`workspace`), is explicitly specified through a `initializationOptions.tsserver.path` setting (`user-setting`) or was bundled with the server (`bundled`)\n\n## Development\n\n### Build\n\n```sh\nyarn build\n```\n\n### Dev\n\nBuild and rebuild on change.\n\n```sh\nyarn dev\n```\n\n### Test\n\n - `yarn test` - run all tests in watch mode for developing\n - `yarn test:commit` - run all tests once\n\nBy default only console logs of level `warning` and higher are printed to the console. You can override the `CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL` level in `package.json` to either `log`, `info`, `warning` or `error` to log other levels.\n\n### Publishing\n\nThe project uses https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action Github action to automatically release new version on merging a release PR.\n\n[npm-version-src]:
