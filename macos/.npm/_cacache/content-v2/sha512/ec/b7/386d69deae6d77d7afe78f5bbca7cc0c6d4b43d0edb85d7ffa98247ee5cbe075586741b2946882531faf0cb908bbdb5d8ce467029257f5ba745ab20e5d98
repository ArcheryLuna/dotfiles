webpack-dev-server\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides\nlive reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Project in Maintenance\n\n**Please note that `webpack-dev-server` is presently in a maintenance-only mode**\nand will not be accepting any additional features in the near term. Most new feature\nrequests can be accomplished with Express middleware; please look into using\nthe [`before`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-before)\nand [`after`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-after)\nhooks in the documentation.\n\nUse [webpack-serve](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-serve) for a fast alternative. Use webpack-dev-server if you need to test on old browsers.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst thing's first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start:dev\": \"webpack-dev-server\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find an bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, of would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions! Please have a read of [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img

webpack-dev-server\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides\nlive reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Project in Maintenance\n\n**Please note that `webpack-dev-server` is presently in a maintenance-only mode**\nand will not be accepting any additional features in the near term. Most new feature\nrequests can be accomplished with Express middleware; please look into using\nthe [`before`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-before)\nand [`after`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-after)\nhooks in the documentation.\n\nUse [webpack-serve](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-serve) for a fast alternative. Use webpack-dev-server if you need to test on old browsers.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst thing's first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start:dev\": \"webpack-dev-server\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find an bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, of would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions! Please have a read of [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img

webpack-dev-server\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides\nlive reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Project in Maintenance\n\n**Please note that `webpack-dev-server` is presently in a maintenance-only mode**\nand will not be accepting any additional features in the near term. Most new feature\nrequests can be accomplished with Express middleware; please look into using\nthe [`before`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-before)\nand [`after`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-after)\nhooks in the documentation.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst thing's first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start:dev\": \"webpack-dev-server\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find an bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, of would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions! Please have a read of [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img

webpack-dev-server\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides\nlive reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Project in Maintenance\n\n**Please note that `webpack-dev-server` is presently in a maintenance-only mode**\nand will not be accepting any additional features in the near term. Most new feature\nrequests can be accomplished with Express middleware; please look into using\nthe [`before`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-before)\nand [`after`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-after)\nhooks in the documentation.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst thing's first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start:dev\": \"webpack-dev-server\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find an bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, of would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions! Please have a read of [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img

This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [With the CLI](#with-the-cli)\n  - [With NPM Scripts](#with-npm-scripts)\n  - [The Result](#the-result)\n- [Browser Support](#browser-support)\n- [Support](#support)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Attribution](#attribution)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst things first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the [webpack CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/). In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack serve\n```\n\n_**Note**: Many CLI options are available with `webpack serve`. Explore this [link](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)._\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start:dev\": \"webpack serve\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module.

webpack-dev-server\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides\nlive reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [With the CLI](#with-the-cli)\n  - [With NPM Scripts](#with-npm-scripts)\n  - [The Result](#the-result)\n- [Browser Support](#browser-support)\n- [Support](#support)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Attribution](#attribution)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst things first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the [webpack CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/). In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack serve\n```\n\nFollowing options are available with `webpack serve`:\n\n```\nUsage: webpack serve|s [entries...] [options]\n\nOptions:\n  -c, --config <value...>    Provide path to a webpack configuration file e.g. ./webpack.config.js.\n  --config-name <value...>   Name of the configuration to use.\n  -m, --merge                Merge two or more configurations using 'webpack-merge'.\n  --env <value...>           Environment passed to the configuration when it is a function.\n  --progress [value]         Print compilation progress during build.\n  -j, --json [value]         Prints result as JSON or store it in a file.\n  -d, --devtool <value>      Determine source maps to use.\n  --no-devtool               Do not generate source maps.\n  --entry <value...>         The entry point(s) of your application e.g. ./src/main.js.\n  --mode <value>             Defines the mode to pass to webpack.\n  --name <value>             Name of the configuration. Used when loading multiple configurations.\n  -o, --output-path <value>  Output location of the file generated by webpack e.g. ./dist/.\n  --stats [value]            It instructs webpack on how to treat the stats e.g. verbose.\n  --no-stats                 Disable stats output.\n  -t, --target <value...>    Sets the build target e.g. node.\n  --watch-options-stdin      Stop watching when stdin stream has ended.\n  --no-watch-options-stdin   Do not stop watching when stdin stream has ended.\n  --host <value>             The hostname/ip address the server will bind to.\n  --port <value>             The port server will listen to.\n  --static [value...]        A directory to serve static content from.\n  --no-static                Negative 'static' option.\n  --live-reload              Enables live reloading on changing files.\n  --no-live-reload           Disables live reloading on changing files.\n  --https                    Use HTTPS protocol.\n  --no-https                 Do not use HTTPS protocol.\n  --http2                    Use HTTP/2, must be used with HTTPS.\n  --no-http2                 Do not use HTTP/2.\n  --bonjour                  Broadcasts the server via ZeroConf networking on start.\n  --client-progress          Print compilation progress in percentage in the browser.\n  --hot-only                 Do not refresh page if HMR fails.\n  --setup-exit-signals       Close and exit the process on SIGINT and SIGTERM.\n  --no-setup-exit-signals    Do not close and exit the process on SIGNIT and SIGTERM.\n  --stdin                    Close when stdin ends.\n  --open [value]             Open the default browser, or optionally specify a browser name.\n  --use-local-ip             Open default browser with local IP.\n  --open-page <value...>     Open default browser with the specified page.\n  --client-logging <value>   Log level in the browser (none, error, warn, info, log, verbose).\n  --history-api-fallback     Fallback to /index.html for Single Page Applications.\n  --no-history-api-fallback  Do not fallback to /index.html for Single Page Applications.\n  --compress                 Enable gzip compression.\n  --no-compress              Disable gzip compression.\n  --public <value>           The public hostname/ip address of the server.\n  --firewall [value...]      Enable firewall or set hosts that are allowed to access the dev server.\n  --no-firewall              Disable firewall.\n\nGlobal options:\n  --color                    Enable colors on console.\n  --no-color                 Disable colors on console.\n  -v, --version              Output the version number of 'webpack', 'webpack-cli' and 'webpack-dev-server' and commands.\n  -h, --help [verbose]       Display help for commands and options.\n```\n\n_**Note**: For more information on above options explore this [link](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)._\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start:dev\": \"webpack serve\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should be the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions! Please have a read of [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis project is heavily inspired by

webpack-dev-server\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides\nlive reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [With the CLI](#with-the-cli)\n  - [With NPM Scripts](#with-npm-scripts)\n  - [The Result](#the-result)\n- [Browser Support](#browser-support)\n- [Support](#support)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Attribution](#attribution)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst things first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the [webpack CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/). In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack serve\n```\n\nFollowing options are available with `webpack serve`:\n\n```\nUsage: webpack serve|s [entries...] [options]\n\nOptions:\n  -c, --config <value...>    Provide path to a webpack configuration file e.g. ./webpack.config.js.\n  --config-name <value...>   Name of the configuration to use.\n  -m, --merge                Merge two or more configurations using 'webpack-merge'.\n  --env <value...>           Environment passed to the configuration when it is a function.\n  --node-env <value>         Sets process.env.NODE_ENV to the specified value.\n  --progress [value]         Print compilation progress during build.\n  -j, --json [value]         Prints result as JSON or store it in a file.\n  -d, --devtool <value>      Determine source maps to use.\n  --no-devtool               Do not generate source maps.\n  --entry <value...>         The entry point(s) of your application e.g. ./src/main.js.\n  --mode <value>             Defines the mode to pass to webpack.\n  --name <value>             Name of the configuration. Used when loading multiple configurations.\n  -o, --output-path <value>  Output location of the file generated by webpack e.g. ./dist/.\n  --stats [value]            It instructs webpack on how to treat the stats e.g. verbose.\n  --no-stats                 Disable stats output.\n  -t, --target <value...>    Sets the build target e.g. node.\n  --no-target                Negative 'target' option.\n  --watch-options-stdin      Stop watching when stdin stream has ended.\n  --no-watch-options-stdin   Do not stop watching when stdin stream has ended.\n  --host <value>             The hostname/ip address the server will bind to.\n  --port <value>             The port server will listen to.\n  --static [value...]        A directory to serve static content from.\n  --no-static                Negative 'static' option.\n  --live-reload              Enables live reloading on changing files.\n  --no-live-reload           Disables live reloading on changing files.\n  --https                    Use HTTPS protocol.\n  --no-https                 Do not use HTTPS protocol.\n  --http2                    Use HTTP/2, must be used with HTTPS.\n  --no-http2                 Do not use HTTP/2.\n  --bonjour                  Broadcasts the server via ZeroConf networking on start.\n  --no-bonjour               Do not broadcast the server via ZeroConf networking on start.\n  --client-progress          Print compilation progress in percentage in the browser.\n  --no-client-progress       Do not print compilation progress in percentage in the browser.\n  --client-overlay           Show a full-screen overlay in the browser when there are compiler errors or warnings.\n  --no-client-overlay        Do not show a full-screen overlay in the browser when there are compiler errors or warnings.\n  --setup-exit-signals       Close and exit the process on SIGINT and SIGTERM.\n  --no-setup-exit-signals    Do not close and exit the process on SIGNIT and SIGTERM.\n  --open [value...]          Open the default browser.\n  --no-open                  Do not open the default browser.\n  --open-app <value>         Open specified browser.\n  --open-target [value...]   Open specified route in browser.\n  --no-open-target           Do not open specified route in browser.\n  --client-logging <value>   Log level in the browser (none, error, warn, info, log, verbose).\n  --history-api-fallback     Fallback to /index.html for Single Page Applications.\n  --no-history-api-fallback  Do not fallback to /index.html for Single Page Applications.\n  --compress                 Enable gzip compression.\n  --no-compress              Disable gzip compression.\n  --public <value>           The public hostname/ip address of the server.\n  --firewall [value...]      Enable firewall or set hosts that are allowed to access the dev server.\n  --no-firewall              Disable firewall.\n  --watch-files <value...>   Watch static files for file changes.\n\nGlobal options:\n  --color                    Enable colors on console.\n  --no-color                 Disable colors on console.\n  -v, --version              Output the version number of 'webpack', 'webpack-cli' and 'webpack-dev-server' and commands.\n  -h, --help [verbose]       Display help for commands and options.\n```\n\n_**Note**: For more information on above options explore this [link](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)._\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"serve\": \"webpack serve\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should be the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions! Please have a read of [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis project is heavily inspired by

Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"serve\": \"webpack serve\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should be the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions!

Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"serve\": \"webpack serve\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should be the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions!

webpack-dev-server\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides\nlive reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [With the CLI](#with-the-cli)\n  - [With NPM Scripts](#with-npm-scripts)\n  - [The Result](#the-result)\n- [Browser Support](#browser-support)\n- [Support](#support)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Attribution](#attribution)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst things first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n_**Note**: Many CLI options are available with `webpack-dev-server`. Explore this [link](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)._\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start:dev\": \"webpack-dev-server\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions! Please have a read of [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis project is heavily inspired by

webpack-dev-server\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides\nlive reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [With the CLI](#with-the-cli)\n  - [With NPM Scripts](#with-npm-scripts)\n  - [With the API](#with-the-api)\n  - [With TypeScript](#with-typescript)\n  - [The Result](#the-result)\n- [Browser Support](#browser-support)\n- [Support](#support)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Attribution](#attribution)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst things first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\nor\n\n```console\nyarn add -D webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nor\n\n```console\npnpm add -D webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the [webpack CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/). In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnpx webpack serve\n```\n\nFollowing options are available with `webpack serve`:\n\n```\nUsage: webpack serve|server|s [entries...] [options]\n\nRun the webpack dev server.\n\nOptions:\n  -c, --config <value...>                             Provide path to a webpack configuration file e.g. ./webpack.config.js.\n  --config-name <value...>                            Name of the configuration to use.\n  -m, --merge                                         Merge two or more configurations using 'webpack-merge'.\n  --disable-interpret                                 Disable interpret for loading the config file.\n  --env <value...>                                    Environment passed to the configuration when it is a function.\n  --node-env <value>                                  Sets process.env.NODE_ENV to the specified value.\n  --define-process-env-node-env <value>               Sets process.env.NODE_ENV to the specified value.

Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"serve\": \"webpack serve\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nNPM will automatically refer to the the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### With the API\n\nWhile it's recommended to run webpack-dev-server via the CLI, you may also choose to start a server via the API.\n\nSee the related [API documentation for `webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/api/webpack-dev-server/).\n\n### With TypeScript\n\nIf you use TypeScript in the webpack config, you'll need to properly type `devServer` property in order to avoid TS errors (e.g. `'devServer' does not exist in type 'Configuration'`). For that use either:\n\n```ts\n/// <reference path=\"node_modules/webpack-dev-server/types/lib/Server.d.ts\"/>\nimport type { Configuration } from \"webpack\";\n\n// Your logic\n```\n\nOr you can import the type from `webpack-dev-server`, i.e.\n\n```ts\nimport type { Configuration as DevServerConfiguration } from \"webpack-dev-server\";\nimport type { Configuration } from \"webpack\";\n\nconst devServer: DevServerConfiguration = {};\nconst config: Configuration = { devServer };\n\n// module.exports\nexport default config;\n```\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should be the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack discussions][discussion-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions!
